This repository contains the code and resources for the paper:  
**"Edge-Based Fusion of LiDAR and Camera Data for Real-Time Colored 3D Point Cloud Generation"**  

## Abstract  
This project investigates the generation of detailed colored 3D point clouds using edge computing platforms. By integrating a 2D LiDAR sensor, a camera module, and a single-board computer, it captures and processes spatial and RGB data in real time.  

Key challenges addressed include:  
- Optimization of algorithms for edge devices.  
- Accurate calibration for fusing spatial and color data.  
- Real-time data processing within limited computational resources.  

The approach ensures precise synchronization of spatial and color information while overcoming edge device limitations. Results demonstrate successful 3D reconstructions without relying on desktop infrastructure, enabling applications in robotics, virtual reality, and portable scanning systems.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Processing**: Generates colored 3D point clouds on edge devices.  
- **Lightweight Design**: Optimized for single-board computers.  
- **Portable Solution**: Ideal for mobile and field applications.  

## Prerequisites
